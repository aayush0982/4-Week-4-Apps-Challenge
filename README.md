# 4Week 4App Challenge

Welcome to the 4Week 4App Challenge repository! This challenge entails the creation of one app per week, each aimed at enhancing my UI/UX and design skills while exploring diverse ideas.

## Project Structure

The repository is meticulously organized, featuring a separate folder for each week's project. Within each project folder, you will find:

- **README.md:** A succinct description of the project, its objectives, and key features.
- **.docx:** Detailed documentation including the app description, images (Android/iPhone views), and a link to the Figma file.

## Table of Contents

- **Week-1:** Event Manager
- **Week-2:** Recipe App
- **Week-3:** OTT App
- **Week-4:** News App

## Getting Started

To view and run a project, simply navigate to the respective week's folder (e.g., App-1/) and download the .docx file through the raw option in your web browser. For additional insights into each project, refer to the README.md file.

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from the code. Should you have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to create an issue or reach out to me.

The primary objectives of this challenge are:

1. Improve my UI/UX skills.
2. Explore various designs and ideas.
3. Develop a portfolio of small projects showcasing my skills.
